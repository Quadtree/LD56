- Bacterium Imperium
  - RTS where you have tons and tons of tiny units
  - That are bacteria
  - Try to take over the world!
  - Cell Types
    1. Converters - Converts sunlight into nutrients, that causes nearby cells to divide
    2. Swarmers - Small spiky bacteria that injure nearby ones
    3. Gobblers - Aggressive attackers that eat Swarmers and Converters
    4. Zoomers - Fast attackers that can usually avoid gobblers, and deal light damage to all enemies
    5. Lobbers - Fire globs of acid long distance that fly over allies. Vulnerable in close combat
  - Contol entirely consists of pressing 1-5 to move your own units toward cursor
  - One key question is if I should do this in Godot or C++
    - C++ is obviously going to be a lot faster on web
